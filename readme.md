# HOW TO IMPLEMENT AN API GATEWAY IN NGINX

### First we need to know what API Gateway is.
when we talking about microservices one of the most important points are the comunication between them, it is crucial for good comunication between services.
With an API gateway it is possible to create a single entry point for requests for different services by centralizing them.
this allows for multiple benefits such as separation in the application layers a single, extra layer of protection among others.
